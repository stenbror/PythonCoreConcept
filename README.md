# PythonCoreConcept
Python 3.9 grammar implemented as a C# 9 library based on record nodes.

This is start of a Roslyn like parser / analyzer for Python code with grammar like 3.9.x implemented as a C# dotnet 5 project.
Possible extension later, will be a full core runtime system for a Python interpreter / compiler for the .net ecosystem.

For now. You can parse EvalInput and FuncInput start rules. This is covvered by UnitTests for happy path. 

See UnitTest for documentation about setup of parsing of file
